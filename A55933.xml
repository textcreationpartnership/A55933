            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

He did farther acquaint them, That they muſt not expect any Formal Charge from him, he expecting that they had received their Directions before they came, for that it had been the common Uſage for the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> to be ſworn and receive their Charge before His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Juſtices came upon the Bench; but ſince he found it otherwiſe, he ſhould not make any ſet formal Charge; nor give any Account of all the Offences that fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Inquiry of the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> by ſuch a <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> at <hi>Common Law;</hi> neither muſt they expect that he ſhould acquaint them with all the Crimes that they might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of, but that it would be ſufficient to tell them the particular Matter of which they were then to inquire, and their Duty concerning that Inquiry. He told them, that he had hinted at firſt, that they were Matters of <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> which is a Crime of the higheſt nature that can be committed againſt Man; That other Crimes, as Felonies, and things of that nature, may make Diſorders and Troubles in a State or Kingdom, but that Treaſons ſtrike at the very Root and Life of all, and are that which deſtroys the Government, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have in all Ages been looked upon as Crimes of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41077:4"/>
higheſt nature that can poſſibly be imagined, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Puniſhments have been allotted to them of the greateſt Severity. He did further acquaint them, That at the <hi>Common Law</hi> there were great variety of <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> about <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and that there had been many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes what was Treaſon, and what was not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was thought fit by the Wiſdom of our Anceſtors to make a Law to declare what ſhould be Treaſon, which was done by the 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. By that Law, for any one to compaſs or imagine or intend the Death of the King, (for he told them he would mention no more of that Statute than was agreeable to the preſent purpoſe) and to declare it by Overt-act, as to levy War againſt the King, and the like, is declared, among other things, to be <hi>High Treaſon;</hi> which Law hath obtain'd for Law amongſt us ever ſince, and that nothing had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Treaſon but what was expreſſed in it, unleſs upon ſome emergent Occaſion, and inſtanc'd in the Laws made in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> upon the occaſion of that inveterate Malice that the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> bore her; and likewiſe in that Law of the 13th. of His now Majeſty, for the making whereof, he told them, the Parliament had great grounds, as they declare in the Preamble of that Statute: for that the Wounds the Kingdom had received were then bleeding, and ſcarcely cloſed, many <hi>Traiterous Poſitions</hi> and Seditious Principles ſpread amongſt the People of this Realm, and that they had good reaſon to believe, that where they had been ſo maliciouſly bent againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and had taken him off, and had maintain'd ſo long and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a War againſt Him and His now Majeſty, almoſt to the deſtruction of all our <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> even to the utter overthrowing of this flouriſhing Kingdom, they ought to be careful to prevent the like Miſchiefs for the future, and therefore did think fit, whereas the Law before was, That it ſhould be Treaſon to conſpire, or to imagine, or to intend the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> ſo as it were declared by Overt-act; now becauſe it was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to ſtay till an Overt-Act ſhould declare the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41077:4"/>
for that they had proceeded ſo far as to take away one Kings Life, and baniſh another, and endeavour to root out the Government of this Kingdom; and therefore did Enact by the ſaid Statute of the 13th. of His now Majeſty, That if any one ſhall compaſs, imagine, or intend the Death of the King, or his Deſtruction, or any Bodily harm, that may tend to His Death and Deſtruction, any reſtraint of His Liberty, by Impriſonment, or otherwiſe; or if they ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and intend to levy any War againſt Him, either within the Realm or without, or deſign or intend to procure any Foreign Prince or others to invade His Dominions, and ſhall ſignifie and declare this by any Writing, by any Printing, by any Preaching, or by any malicious and adviſed Speaking, and uttering Words to the ſame intent and purpoſe, this ſhall be <hi>High Treaſon;</hi> which, he told them, had altered the <hi>Law</hi> in two Caſes. 1. <hi>As to levying War, the Intention was not Treaſon before, unleſs it took eſſect:</hi> And, 2. <hi>As to deſigning and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Kings Death, which was not Treaſon unleſs declared by an Overt-act; and as to the impriſoning His Perſon, or reſtraining Him of His Liberty, the very deſigning of them alone are made Treaſon, whether they take effect or not: tho theſe ſhould be time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevented, that there be no hurt done, yet the very Deſign, if it be uttered or ſpoken, is made Treaſon by this Act:</hi> Which makes a great alteration in the Law. Formerly it was ſaid, <hi>Words alone would not amount to Treaſon;</hi> but ſince this Act, Words, if they import any malicious Deſign againſt the King, any traiterous Intention in the Party, are <hi>Treaſon.</hi> He did further acquaint the Jury, That this Act was made with the greateſt care and prudence imaginable, to take off that Liberty that People had taken to themſelves, in that time of Licentiouſneſs, wherein they were ſo bold to vent all their ſeditious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Thoughts and Intentions each to other, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; and therefore told the Jury, That they ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Words, whether they ſignifie or purport any Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Intention in the Party; either againſt the King or His Government, either to reſtrain His Liberty, or to do Him any Bodily hurt, or any thing of that nature, which he told them was Treaſon, within the <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi> And as to their Inquiry, they were in the Sphere they ſtood in upon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41077:5"/>
Indictments brought before them, to conſider theſe things: Whether the Matter brought before them were within that Act of Parliament? And in that, if they doubted, they were to adviſe, as to Matters of Law, with thoſe that were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated by His Majeſty: And that they were to inquire, Whether there were Two Witneſſes to prove the Treaſon? becauſe no Man without two Witneſſes ought to be puniſh'd within that Law; but withal did obſerve to them, That it had been reſolved by all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> upon a moſt ſolemn Occaſion, That it is not neceſſary that there be two Witneſſes to prove the ſame Words ſpoken at the ſame time, or in the ſame place; but if one proves the Words that import a Treaſonable Intention, ſpoken at one time, and in one place, and others at another time, and in another place, theſe are good Witneſſes within the Statute to prove the Treaſon. He told them, That what was referr'd to them, was to conſider what Evidence ſhould be given them, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon that Evidence there were not reaſon to call the Perſon to an Account? for if there were probable Grounds for it, that was as much as they were to inquire into: That they muſt conſider this, That as it is a Crime to condemn Innocent Perſons, ſo it is a Crime as great to acquit the Guilty; ſo that they ought to be as ſtrict in the one as in the other. He farther told them, That if they ſhould be refractory, and where there was a probable Ground for an Accuſation, ſhould undertake to intercept Juſtice by not finding the Bill, it would lie at their Doors; that they were under a double Obligation, one as they were <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen,</hi> and ſo Members of the ſame Body; they ought to conſider, that Crimes of this nature ought not to go unpuniſhed; the other, as they had an Oath of God upon them; they were ſworn to Inquire truly according to their Evidence; and therefore if there were two Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Words that might import a treaſonable Deſign or Intention in the Party, they were bound both by the Law of Nature, as they are Members of the ſame Body, and by the Law of <hi>God,</hi> as they have taken an <hi>Oath,</hi> to find the <hi>Bill.</hi> He told them, that it was neither their Province, nor thoſe whom His Majeſty had Commiſſionated, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41077:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or pitiful, for that is reſerved to a higher and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Power from which both theirs is derived; and therefore did require them to hear ſuch Evidence as ſhould be given, and to be impartial as to what they ſhould hear from the Witneſſes; and if there were ground ſufficient to believe that there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the King to call the Parties to anſwer what is objected againſt them, they were bound to find the Bills, and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God Almightie Prayer to direct them.</p>
            <p>After which he acquainted them, that the Kings Council (who were Sir <hi>Fran. Withins,</hi> Kt. Mr. <hi>Saunders,</hi> Mr. <hi>Heath,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi>) moved that the Evidence might be publickly given, that ſo there might be no occaſion of ſlandering the Witneſſes, which he told them was a motion ought not to be denied</p>
            <p>Then the Jury demanded a Copy of their Oath, which was granted them by the Court, and they immediately withdrew, and after a quarter of an hours ſtay returned, and Sir. <hi>Sam. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardiſton,</hi> the Fore-man of the Jury, did acquaint the Court, that it was the opinion of the Jury, that it was their right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Witneſſes in private; for that it had been alwas the Practice both in City and Country, and they did inſiſt upon it for this reaſon, becauſe they were by their Oaths bound to keep the Kings Secrets, and their own, which it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to do, if the Witneſſes ſhould be examined in Court.</p>
            <p>To which the Ld. Ch. Juſtice <hi>Pemberton</hi> gave this Anſwer, That it might probably be, that the common uſage had brought the Jury into that Error, that it was their right, and therefore did inform them, that it was not their right, but that it was done only to comply with the convenience of the Court; for generally upon all Commiſſions of the like nature, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was much, and that upon Gaol-Deliveries, there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Priſoners to be tried, and other things to be done, ſo that if at ſuch a time they ſhould examine all Witneſſes in Court, that came before the Grand Jury, in order to finding the Bills, it would make the Commiſſions of too great a length, and that therefore the Judges have allowed this Practice, and not that it is their right; for that without queſtion originally all Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were examined in Court; and further told them, that it was for their advantage, as well as for the Kings, that it might be ſeen that they complied with their Evidence, and did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing clandeſtinely; and beſides that, the King deſired it, and that they were bound to comply with his deſire; but yet that they ſhould have the ſame liberty in Court they could have in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41077:6"/>
private to ask the Witneſſes what queſtions they pleaſed: And further told them, that as to keeping their Counſels, that was a thing of another nature, which were their own private Debates.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Papillion,</hi> one of the Jury, offered 4 things to the Court, the firſt was the ſame in ſubſtance with what Sir <hi>S. Barnard.</hi> had offered before. The 2d was, that it having been a common uſuage, was now grown to be the Law of the Land, and that ſo not to be altered, &amp; therefore deſired the opinion of the Court; for that as they were not willing to do any thing that might be in the leaſt prejudicial to His Majeſty, ſo neither to the Liberty of the Subject. The third thing was, That this publick Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation might be prejudicial to His Majeſty; for that ſometimes upon private Examinations of Witneſſes, the Jury have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered perſons guilty of Treaſons, and miſpriſions of Treaſons, which were not before diſcovered, and have thereupon ſent down to the Court and acquainted them with them, and the Traitors have been ſecured, which by publick Examination (notice might have been taken) and been prevented. And the fourth thing was, That all the Evidence is hereby known before it comes to the main Tryal upon the iſſue, whereby this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience may enſue that Perſons may be brought to confront the Witneſſes, and invalidate their Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>To which the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Pemberton</hi> made anſwer to this effect, That if they had well conſidered what he had ſaid before, he ſhould have thought the objections to have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated; but as to keeping their own ſecrets they are bound but as to the Kings, if he pleaſe to make them publick, who ſhall hinder it? And as to the common uſage he told them that there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers preſidents out of the allowance of publick examinations in theſe caſes, and that he never heard it denyed before, and that the way antiently was to examine all in Court. The Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>North</hi> ſpake much to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Then the Jury demanded that it might be recorded that they did inſiſt upon the examination of the Witneſſes in private, which was denied by the Court, for this reaſon that they were not bound to record any thing but what was in order to proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Indictment.</p>
            <p>It was moved that the Witneſſes might be kept out of Court, and but one brought in at a time, which was granted to the Jury.</p>
            <p>Then the Bill was read againſt <hi>Anth.</hi> E. of <hi>S.</hi> the ſubſtance of which was to this effect, That he 18 <hi>Mar.</hi> 33 of this King,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41077:6"/>
did Traiterouſly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> provide Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the ſame time did ſpeak theſe words, That the Parliament was to meet at <hi>Oxford</hi> within a ſhort time, and that he had conſidered of the inclinations, and diſpoſitions of the Perſons Elected, and that he was ſatisfied that the Parliament would inſiſt upon the ſame matters the former Parliament had done, which were the Bill of Excluſion, the repealing 35 <hi>Eli.</hi> and the paſſing the Bill for uniting Proteſtant Diſſenters, with other wholſome Bills, which he was certain the King would refuſe, and therefore he did expect that there would be breach between the Kings Majeſty, and his Parliament, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Noble Men, and worthy Members of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons concurred in the ſame opinion, and that they had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to inſiſt upon it, and if the King ſhould refuſe, than he the ſaid E. of <hi>S.</hi> and the ſaid Nobles, and worthy Members would compel the Kings Majeſty to conſent thereunto, and that on the part of him the ſaid E. of <hi>S.</hi> he would provide valiant Men to be Commanded by Captain <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> and that <hi>John Booth</hi> ſhould be one; And further, that our Soveraign Lord the King is a Man of no Faith; and that there was no truſt in him, and that our Soveraign Lord the King deſerved to be depoſed, as <hi>Richard</hi> 2. late King of <hi>England</hi> was. And further that he the ſaid E. of <hi>S.</hi> never would deſiſt, till he had brought the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England</hi> into a Common-wealth, and that the ſaid E. of <hi>S.</hi> and thoſe that would aſſiſt him the ſaid E. of <hi>S.</hi> would make this Kingdom a Common-wealth as <hi>Holland</hi> was, and that he the ſaid E. of <hi>S.</hi> and other Traitors unknown, would live as they do in <hi>Holland,</hi> and our ſaid Soveraign Lord the King and his whole Family would extirpate, and that our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord the King was a Man of an unfaithful heart, and not worthy to Reign and Govern, that he was falſe, unjuſt, and cruel againſt his People, and that if he would not be Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his People, he the ſaid E. of <hi>S.</hi> and others would depoſe him our ſaid Soveraign Lord the King againſt the duty of his Allegiance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the reading of which Indictment the ſaid Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil inſiſted upon opening the Evidence to the Jury; but the Court denyed it.</p>
            <p>After which, the Jury deſired a note of the names of the Witneſſes, which was denied them for this reaſon, that they muſt have the Indictment out with them, and their names are recorded on the back of the Indictment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41077:7"/>Then Sir <hi>Samuel Barnardiſton</hi> deſired to ſee the Warran, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the E. of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> was committed, and told them that they had great reaſon for that requeſt, to which the L. C. J. <hi>P.</hi> gave this anſwer, That they could not do it, for that the Lieutenant of the Tower kept it for his own indempnity, and they could not command it from him.</p>
            <p>Then they began the Examination of the Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Mr. <hi>Blackthwait</hi> was examined, who produced a Paper, and his Teſtimony was to this effect, that he received the ſame from Mr. <hi>Gwyn</hi> another of the Clarks of the Council, who told him that he ſeized that Paper amongſt others in the E. of <hi>Shaftes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buries</hi> Houſe, and that Mr. <hi>Gwyn</hi> gave him the Key where the Papers that were ſeized, were kept, and that it had been altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Cuſtody, except a little time that Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins,</hi> one of His Majeſties Secr. of State had it, who re-delivered it him again, that when he was ordered by the Committee of Examinations, he brought the Trunk and Papers into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Chamber, and they were opened in the preſence of ſeveral Lords, and of Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> who was appointed to attend on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the E. of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> and that this Paper was taken out of a velvet bag that was in the Trunk on the 6th of <hi>July</hi> laſt.</p>
            <p>Then was called Mr. <hi>Gwyn,</hi> who informed the Court to this purpoſe, That on the 2d of <hi>July</hi> laſt paſt, he was commanded by a Warrant from the Secretary, to go to the E. of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi>'s Houſe to ſearch his Papers, and that he there met with a great many Papers, which he put into a Trunk, and delivered it, with the Key of it, to Mr. <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwait,</hi> but knew not how the Papers were divided and taken out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; and doth further ſay, that there was nothing in the Velvet Bag, but what he took in the E of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi>'s Cloſet.</p>
            <p>Then Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> teſtified, that that was the Paper among others that was delivered into his Hands by Mr. <hi>Blackthwait</hi> in the Council Chamber, and declared that the ſame had not been altered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it came to his Hands.</p>
            <p>Then the Paper was read, the purport whereof was the Form of an ASSOCIATION, to be entred into by as many of the King's Subjects as pleaſed, for the defence of the King's Perſon, the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Laws of the Land, againſt the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> and all that adhere to Popery and Arbitrary Power.</p>
            <p>The next Witneſs produced was <hi>John Booth,</hi> who ſwore to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: That in <hi>January</hi> laſt he was introduced into the E of <hi>S</hi>'s acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by one Capt. <hi>Hen. Wilkinſon,</hi> occaſioned by the ſaid Captain's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received a Commiſſion from the E. of <hi>S.</hi> and others, to be Deputy Governour of <hi>Carolina,</hi> with whom the ſaid <hi>John Booth</hi> was to go, and had ſeveral Diſcourſes with the E. of <hi>S.</hi> thereupon; but afterwards grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into further acquaintance with his Ldſhip, &amp; talking with him of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of Parlm &amp; Arbitrary Power, &amp; the fear of Popery, when Memb. were choſen to ſerve in Parlm. he would often ſay, that he had conſidered the Parlm. that was to meet at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the perſons elected, their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and diſpoſitions, that they would inſiſt on the ſame things that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41077:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Parliaments</hi> had done who went before them, particulary the <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Excluſion,</hi> and aboliſhing the 35th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty giving his Aſſent to a <hi>Bill</hi> whereby the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> might be freed from the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Puniſhments</hi> they are liable to. That he ſaid further, That if theſe were paſt, he believed then that they would be very willing to grant the <hi>King</hi> ſuch Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Money, as his neceſſary occaſions ſhould require: But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, he believed there would be a Breach betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And he feared the contrivance of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> ſitting at <hi>Oxford,</hi> was to over-awe them; and therefore ſaid, That he and divers <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> had conſidered their own ſafety. He for his own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar had prepar'd 50 men, which he committed to the command of Capt. <hi>Wilkinſon;</hi> and if there ſhould have chanc'd to have been a Breach betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> that if there were any violence offered, all the reſt had provided as well as he; and that they would repel the force, and purge the Guards of all <hi>Papiſts</hi> that were Enemies to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and the eſtahliſh'd Laws of the Land. And likewiſe, that they did intend by theſe Forces to take from the <hi>King</hi> thoſe <hi>Evil Counſellors,</hi> as he call'd them, the Marquiſs of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> the E. of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> the E. of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> the E. of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> and the L. <hi>Hide;</hi> who were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly named to give the <hi>King</hi> evil Advice: And then that they did intend to bring the <hi>King</hi> hither, that ſo all things might be ſetled for the ſecurity of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and providing againſt <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power.</hi> That Capt. <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> did deſire him to be one of them, and did requeſt that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for himſelf Horſe and Arms, and that Capt. <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> would provide a Horſe for his Man; and that he did provide all; and that things happen'd at <hi>Oxford</hi> as my L. <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had predicted. But it was neither believ'd nor imagin'd that they would have been ſo ſoon diſſolved as they were. On Thurſday Capt. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon</hi>'s expected Summons to go down to <hi>Oxford</hi> with thoſe men that were ordered him by the E. of <hi>Shaft.</hi> came; and on the Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following News came of the Diſſolution of the <hi>Parliament.</hi> All this he ſaith he firſt diſcovered to one <hi>Walter Bains,</hi> and then writ down his Information with his own hand, and ſent it to the <hi>Secretary</hi> Sir <hi>L. Jenkins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Witneſs produced, was <hi>Edw. Turbervile,</hi> who ſaith, That about the beginning of <hi>February</hi> laſt, he went to deſire my L. <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> to aſſiſt him in the getting in ſome Money that was then behind and unpaid by the <hi>King;</hi> and that he did then ſay, there was little hopes of any good from the <hi>King,</hi> ſo long as he hath any Guards about him: For were it not for his Guards, they would
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41077:8"/>
quickly go to <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and ſoon compel him to do what they would have him.</p>
            <p>Next came <hi>John Smith;</hi> the ſubſtance of whoſe Teſtimony was, That he had oftentimes heard my L. <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſpeak very refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting on the King, That he was a weak man, unconſtant, unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, a man of no firm reſolution, a man that was wholly led by the Noſe as his Father was before him, by a <hi>Popiſh Queen,</hi> to his ruine: That the E. of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> hearing that the King ſhould ſay that he the E. of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was the great Contriver and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of the Rebellion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the E. of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> made this Anſwer, That the King did not ſee his own danger; and bid them tell the King, That if he had a mind to raiſe a Rebellion, he could raiſe another kind of Rebellion than that in <hi>Scotland.</hi> He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith, That my L. <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſent for him by one <hi>Manly,</hi> and when he came, he told him, That he ſent to him upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Iriſh Witneſſes,</hi> becauſe Mr. <hi>Hetherington</hi> had been with him, and told him he was afraid they would go over to the Court, and retract what they had ſaid formerly; and told him, That that he would have him do, was to diſſwade them from going over; for that Rogue <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> was pampered up by the Court-Party to ſtifle the Plot: And that there could be no other deſign at Court, appeared by the many Proroguations and Diſſolutions of Parliaments. That the <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> in <hi>England</hi> was gone; that there will be an <hi>Act of Oblivion,</hi> and then comes in <hi>Popery:</hi> for we are all ſatisfied that the King is as much concern'd in bringing in <hi>Popery,</hi> as the <hi>Duke</hi> is. That purſuant to the E. of <hi>Shaftsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s inſtructions, he met <hi>Hetherington</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh Witneſſes,</hi> and laid before them the horrid Crimes that <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> was guilty of in denying the <hi>Plot;</hi> and told them what a Crime it was for them to come into his company: Upon which, they promiſed that they would never come neer him more. That he went with <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Dennis</hi> before Sir <hi>Patience Ward,</hi> the then Lord Mayor, and that <hi>Dennis</hi> ſwore, that <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> had been tampering with divers of the <hi>Iriſh Evidence.</hi> That he carried the <hi>Information</hi> to my L. <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> who was mightily pleaſed with it, and uttered himſelf in theſe words: Do not you ſee the villany of the <hi>Popiſh Party</hi> and that Faction; and that the King runs the ſame way his Father did; and that he is led by a <hi>Popiſh Queen</hi> as his Father was, and doth not ſee his danger, nor will not, till he comes to the ſame End his Father did? And that before the <hi>Parliament</hi> went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> falling into ſome other Diſcourſe with the ſaid Earl, he ſaid, That there was great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration made to terrifie the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and to make them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41077:8"/>
with the <hi>King;</hi> but that will not do, though 'tis plain, that by removing the <hi>Parliament</hi> thither they intend to bring in Popery: but we have this advantage, that if he offer any violence, as 'tis ſuſpected he will, we have the Nation on our ſide, and we may very lawfully depoſe him; and all the Gentlemen of the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> will be well horſed and armed, and eſpecially the <hi>City-Members,</hi> who will have ſo many men ſent on purpoſe to wait upon them: And he declared that he would die rather than not accompliſh the Deſign: Whereupon <hi>Smith</hi> told him, that would ruine Monarchy; and his Lordſhip replied, No doubt on't; but yet he would ſtand and fall by it.</p>
            <p>Next ſtood up <hi>Brian Hains,</hi> who agreed with <hi>Smith,</hi> that my L. <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had oft vilified the King in his hearing; and told him, that if he would ſwear the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmunbury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> upon the E. of <hi>Danby,</hi> they would make their applications to the King for a Pardon for him. To which <hi>Hains</hi> replied, That he was ſure the King would never grant it, becauſe he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued and diſſolved ſo many Parliaments for the E. of <hi>Danby.</hi> Do not fear it, ſays the E. of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> for if he doth not grant it, the whole Kingdom will riſe in Arms againſt him, and this is the beſt time for it in the world; and if he do not do it, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect to be long King of <hi>England:</hi> And that he asking him whether he ſhould go beyond Sea, No, replied the Earl, he dare as well be hang'd as meddle with you. Afterwards, being in cloſe conference with the Earl one day, and having given him ſo exact an Account of all the Tranſactions from the commencement of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's Reign to this very day, he was mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied with it: Pray, my Lord, ſaid he, what do you intend to do? Why, replies the Earl, there are Families enough in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> that have as much right to the <hi>Crown</hi> as the King; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the D. of <hi>Bucks,</hi> who hath a right to the Barony of <hi>Roſs,</hi> and in that right to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then appeared <hi>John Macnamarra,</hi> who teſtified to the Jury, that my L. <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſhould ſay, That the King was Popiſhly affected, and adhered to Popery, and took the ſame methods his Father did, that had brought his Father's Head to the Block, and would do his too; and that this he had told divers perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity five years ago. He ſaid that the King was a faithleſs man, and there was no credit to be given to him; and that the D. of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine</hi> was his Cabinet-council, who was the worſt of women; and that the King did deſerve to be depoſed as much as <hi>Rich.</hi> the 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dennis Macnamarra</hi>'s Evidence was much the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edw. Ivy</hi> ſwore, that the Earl told him, That the King was an
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41077:9"/>
unjuſt man, and not fit to reign; that he was a Papiſt in his Heart, and did intend to introduce Popery; and that they did intend to depoſe him for his injuſtice to his People; and that he brought <hi>Hains</hi> into his Lordſhip's acquaintance, who was by his inſtigation to ſwear the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmunbury Godfrey</hi> againſt the E. of <hi>Danby,</hi> the Duke, and the Queen; and then he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take care of him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly appeared <hi>Bernard Dennis,</hi> who after a long Harangue to little purpoſe, ſpoke to this effect; That diſcourſing with the E. of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> he asked him how many ſtout able men there were of his name in his County? He told him about three or four hundred. Saith the Earl, I would willingly have you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance them of your own name and Friends, by being in a readineſs when occaſion ſhall happen, and to ſtand by us; for we intend to have <hi>England</hi> a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and to live in <hi>England</hi> as they do in <hi>Holland;</hi> and to have no Supream Head, no particular man for King, nor owe obedience to a Crown: And that he ſaid they would extirpate the King and all his Family; and that he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that other Nations would be ſuch Fools as they were, for it is certain that Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> K. <hi>James,</hi> K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and the now King wronged them; and that if they had been under a Commonwealth, they would have taken more care of them than the King doth; and the people of <hi>England</hi> are fools that they do not uſurp againſt the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the <hi>L. C. J.</hi> acquainted the <hi>Jury</hi> that the <hi>Kings Council</hi> would examine no more <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> therefore if they deſired to ask any of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> any thing, they ſhould have them all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for one by one.</p>
            <p>Then Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton</hi> deſired that they might have leave to go out and conſider of what Queſtions to ask: And the <hi>Jury</hi> deſired to know what <hi>Statute</hi> or <hi>Statutes</hi> the <hi>Bill</hi> was founded upon? My <hi>L. C. J.</hi> anſwered them, That that which is <hi>Treaſon</hi> within the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 25 of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3d, is <hi>Treaſon</hi> within the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 13 of this King; ſo that this is more copious, in that it hath enlarged that in many particulars; and therefore when one <hi>Statute</hi> contains the matter of a former, and enlarges it, the <hi>Indictment</hi> is always upon the laſt. But my <hi>L. C. J. North</hi> diſtinguiſhed where the <hi>Indictment</hi> is laid <hi>Contra formam Statuti, &amp; contra formam Statut.</hi> for in the firſt Caſe it extends but to one ſingle Statute; and in the laſt, to all that concern the ſame matter.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton</hi> deſired they might ſee the <hi>Affidavits</hi> of <hi>Subornation</hi> that were made againſt ſeveral of the <hi>Witneſſes.</hi> To which the <hi>Court</hi> replied,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41077:9"/>That the credibility of the Witneſſes is not a matter proper before them, but only upon a Tryal, for there the King will be armed to defend the credit of his Witneſſes, if any thing be objected againſt them. That they are only to ſee whether the Statute be ſatisfied in having matter that is Treaſonable before them, and teſtified by two Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Papilion</hi> told the Court they deſired only that which was proved, and if there be ſuch Informations in Court, they being things proved they deſire to ſee them; and the Court telling them that they could not grant it, they being things not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of their Inquiry, it was asked by Mr. <hi>Papilion,</hi> whether they were not to exerciſe their own reaſon and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; To which the Court replyed, that any thing that was of their own knowledge they ought to take into conſideration;</p>
            <p>My <hi>L. Chief Juſt. North</hi> told them, that a Grand Jury is to hear no Evidence againſt the King, it is not the courſe. That is to be upon the Tryal before the Petty Jury, therefore for you to enter into a nice Examination of the Credit of the witneſſes is not to be ſuffered.</p>
            <p>Then the Court adjourn'd till three in the Afternoon.</p>
            <p>The Court being again ſate, and the Grand Jury come in, they proceeded to interrogate the Witneſſes one by one.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gwyn</hi> was firſt Examined, who put up the Earl of <hi>Shaftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buries</hi> Papers? He anſwered he did it himſelf. Being asked whoſe hand writing it was? He anſwered he knew not. Being asked whether there was a talk of a Bill of Aſſociation, or that he had heard of it? He anſwered, Yes.</p>
            <p>Secr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> being ask'd the ſame queſtion, ſaid he was not preſent at the debate, he was not certain, he did not remember the particulars. Being asked whether he was preſent when the Aſſociation in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time was read in the Houſe of Commons, anſwered no. When he was asked when my Lord was committed, he anſwered he referred himſelf to the Warant, but being asked the ſame queſtion, by my <hi>L. Chief Juſt. Pemberton.</hi> He anſwered that he referred himſelf to the Serjeant at Arms, but he thought it was in <hi>July.</hi> Being asked whether all the Witneſſes were Examined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Commitment? He anſwered, he did not know whether all or no, but ſeveral of them were, but how many he could not tell.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Booth</hi> was call'd for by the <hi>Jury,</hi> but not appearing they ſaid a Tipſtaff was gone for him, which gave occaſion to Sir <hi>Samuel Barnardiſton</hi> to ask whether he was a Priſoner or no, to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41077:10"/>
which the <hi>Attorny General</hi> replied, yes for debt. But at length he appeared, and being asked what time it was that he had the diſcourſe with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and where? He anſwered at his own Houſe, a week or ten days before the Parliament ſate at <hi>Oxford.</hi> Being asked who was preſent he anſwered no body but my Lord and himſelf. When he was asked how often he had been there, he ſaid five or ſix times. Being asked how long it was after my Lord ſpoke the words before he diſcovered them, he ſaid ſeven Weeks. Being asked whether he was Examined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Commitment? He anſwered, No. Being asked to whom he gave his Information? He anſwered to the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. And being asked by whom he conveyed his Information? He anſwered by <hi>Bains,</hi> and whether he knew any more of my Lords Guard of 50 men then Captain <hi>Wilkinſon?</hi> He anſwered no.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Turbervil</hi> was called and asked who was preſent when my Lord ſpoke thoſe words to him? He anſwered one of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that uſed to dreſs my Lord, and no body elſe by, that he doth remember. Being asked when it was that my Lord ſpoke the Words? He ſaith the ſixth of <hi>February,</hi> to the beſt of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance in the Morning. Being asked how long twas before he diſcovered it? He anſwered the 4th. of <hi>July</hi> after. Being ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to whom the Information was given? He ſaid to Mr. <hi>Secr. Jenkins.</hi> Being asked whether my Lord was committed before or after his Information? He ſaid he could not be poſitive, but he beleived before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Smith</hi> was called and asked whether he did not uſe to go by the name of <hi>Barry?</hi> To which he anſwered he had gone by ſeveral names, and ſo do all Popiſh Prieſts. Being asked what Religion he was of? he ſaid he was a Proteſtant. Being ask'd how long? he ſaid many a year. Being asked when he was converted? he ſaid, he was firſt a Proteſtant, then perverted to the Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and then turn'd Proteſtant again. Being ask'd when he receiv'd the Sacrament? he ſaid three months ago. Being ask'd when he gave his Evidence firſt, and to whom? he thinks after the Commitment, but is not poſitive, and he gave it into Secretary <hi>Jenkins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bernard Hains</hi> being ask'd when he gave in his Information and to whom? he anſwered to Secretary <hi>Jenkins</hi> juſt before my Lord was committed. Being asked whether he gave in an Information of a deſign againſt my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury?</hi> and to whom? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, he did to Sir <hi>George Treby:</hi> and being asked when? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in <hi>March?</hi> and being asked when my L. <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſpoke
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41077:10"/>
theſe words, he anſwered, a little before he made that Affidavit to Sir <hi>George Treby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Macnamarra</hi> being asked when he had this diſcourſe with my L. <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> he anſwered the latter end of <hi>March</hi> or the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>April.</hi> Being asked when he gave this Information in? he ſaid before his Commitment, and being ask'd to whom? he ſaid to Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins.</hi> Being asked whether he did petition the <hi>Common Council,</hi> he owned that he ſigned a <hi>Petition,</hi> but ſaid he knew not what was in it. But Mr. <hi>Papilion</hi> inform'd the Court, that they did ſuggeſt themſelves in that Petition, that they were tampered with to be ſuborn'd, and therefore prayed relief from the <hi>City,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Denis Macnamarra</hi> being ask'd how he came to my Lord? he ſaid by his Brother. Being asked when it was? he ſaid the latter end of <hi>March</hi> or the beginning of <hi>April.</hi> Being asked who was with him? he ſaid only Mr. <hi>Ivy</hi> and his Brother. Being ask'd when he gave in his Information? he acknowledged it to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Earls Commitment. Being asked to whom, he anſwered to Secretary <hi>Jenkins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward Ivy</hi> being asked what time he had this diſcourſe with the Earl? he ſaid a little after the ſitting of the Parliament at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> the latter end of <hi>April</hi> or the beginning of <hi>May.</hi> Being asked who was by? he ſaid both the <hi>Macnamarra</hi>'s only. Being asked when and to whom he gave his Information? he anſwered before my Lords commitment, and to Secretary <hi>Jenkins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bernard Denis</hi> being asked when my Lord ſpoke the words? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered four or five dayes after the Parliament was diſſolved at <hi>Oxford.</hi> Being asked when he made the Information and to whom? he ſaith to Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> in <hi>June.</hi> Being asked why he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it ſo long? he ſaith becauſe he was in the City. Being ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether ever he went about his four hundred men in <hi>Ireland?</hi> he ſaith he did adviſe them to be ready. Being asked what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion he is of? he ſaith a Ptoteſtant ever ſince <hi>February</hi> laſt.</p>
            <p>The laſt eight being every man of them asked ſeverally and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part upon their particular Examinations, where my Lord ſpoke this <hi>Treaſon,</hi> they all ſay he ſpoke the Treaſon in his own houſe, except <hi>Brian Hains,</hi> who ſaith, that at another time, he heard him ſpeak Treaſon in <hi>Iron-monger</hi> Lane. And being all asked whether they have heard him ſpeak any other Treaſon in any other Place, or at any other time, than is in their particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination ſet forth, they all anſwered, that they did not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:41077:11"/>And being all particularly interrogated further, whether they had any thing as a preſent Reward, or any allowance from any Perſon for the ſwearing againſt the E. of <hi>Shaftsbury:</hi> They all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, No.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, twenty of the Jury (Mr. <hi>Tho Parker</hi> being ſick and excuſed) for what reaſons he that reads this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation may eaſily gather, brought in the Bill IGNORAMUS.</p>
